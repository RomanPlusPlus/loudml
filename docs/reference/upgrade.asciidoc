= Upgrade Loud ML

[partintro]

Loud ML can usually be upgraded using a <<rolling-upgrades,Rolling upgrade>>
process so upgrading minimizes service interrupt time. However, you might
need to <<training-upgrades,Retrain to upgrade>> models created in older versions.

[IMPORTANT]
===========================================
Before upgrading Loud ML:

* Review the breaking changes for changes that
affect your application.
* Check the deprecation log to see if you are using
any deprecated features.
* If you use custom plugins, make sure compatible versions are available.
* Test upgrades in a development environment before upgrading your production environment
* <<training-snapshot,Back up your training data>> before upgrading.
You **cannot roll back** to an earlier version unless you have a backup of
your training data.
