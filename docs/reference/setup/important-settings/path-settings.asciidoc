=== `storage.path` and `logs.path`

If you are using the `.whl` or `egg` archives, the `storage` and `logs`
directories are sub-folders of `$LM_HOME`.  If these important folders are left
in their default locations, there is a high risk of them being deleted while
upgrading Loud ML to a new version.

In production use, you will almost certainly want to change the locations of the
storage and log folder:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
storage:
  path: /var/lib/loudml
logs:
  path: /var/log/loudml
--------------------------------------------------

The RPM and Debian distributions already use custom paths for `storage` and `logs`.
