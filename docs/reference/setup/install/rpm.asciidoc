[[rpm-repo]]
==== Installing from the RPM repository

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {version} of Loud ML has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

Create a file called `loudml.repo` in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory
for RedHat based distributions, or in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d/` directory for
OpenSuSE based distributions, containing:

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="released"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
[loudml-{major-version}]
name=LoudML packages for Enterprise Linux 7 - $basearch
baseurl=http://loudml.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/repo/rpm/7/$basearch
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://loudml.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/repo/gpg/GPG-KEY-LOUDML
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
--------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

And your repository is ready for use. You can now install Loud ML with one of the following commands:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo yum install loudml loudml-elastic loudml-influx<1>
sudo dnf install loudml loudml-elastic loudml-influx<2>

[[rpm-running-init]]
==== Running Loud ML with SysV `init`

Use the `chkconfig` command to configure Loud ML to start automatically
when the system boots up:

--------------------------------------------------
sudo chkconfig --add loudmld
--------------------------------------------------

Loud ML can be started and stopped using the `service` command:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
sudo -i service loudmld start
sudo -i service loudmld stop

[[rpm-configuring]]
==== Configuring Loud ML

include::etc-loudml.asciidoc[]

The RPM also has a system configuration file (`/etc/sysconfig/loudml`),
which allows you to set the following parameters:

include::sysconfig-file.asciidoc[]

NOTE: Distributions that use `systemd` require that system resource limits be
configured via `systemd` rather than via the `/etc/sysconfig/loudml`
file.  See <<systemd>> for more information.
