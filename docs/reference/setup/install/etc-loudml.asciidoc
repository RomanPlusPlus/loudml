Loud ML defaults to using `/etc/loudml` for runtime configuration.
The ownership of this directory and all files in this directory are set to
`root:loudml` on package installation and the directory has the `setgid`
flag set so that any files and subdirectories created under `/etc/loudml`
are created with this ownership as well. It is expected that this be maintained so
that the `loudmld`  process can read the files under this directory via the
group permissions.

Loud ML loads its configuration from the
`/etc/loudml/config.yml` file by default.  The format of this
configuration file is explained in <<settings>>.

Loud ML loads and saves its runtime data from the
`/var/lib/loudml` directory. The content of this directory must not
be edited.
