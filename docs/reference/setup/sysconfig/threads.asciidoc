=== Number of threads

Loud ML uses a number of thread pools for different types of operations. The
actual number of threads will default to the minimum of either the local
processor count, or the limit defined in your licence.

The package distributions when run as services under `systemd` will configure
the number of threads for the loudmld process automatically. No
additional configuration is required.
