=== Overview

Ubuntu lovers, we have now introduced Ubuntu 18.04 support! You can refer to the installation instructions and make sure the `python3-lib2to3` dependency is installed.

1.4.2 fixes issues that have been detected in previous versions, and includes security fixes.

Again, if youâ€™re using an old release, please migrate to 1.4.2 to avoid sensitive information being leaked via the REST API.

=== Changes

Changes introduced in Loud ML 1.4.2: 

* Ubuntu 18.04 packages
* RPM scriptlet fixes. You will no longer have to run `systemctl daemon-reload` manually after an upgrade
* Important security fix: no longer leak password or other sensitive information via the REST API. If you are using an old release, please migrate to 1.4.2!
* https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/42[#42]: you can now define the Elasticsearch `doc_type` in `config.yml` file
* Fix an error condition where the internal `state.json` file could become corrupted, and prevent `loudmld` from returning the model list
* Fix `lower_%` and `upper_%` values returned when forecasting non stationary data
* A `grace_period` setting can be set in your model configuration. If set, Loud ML will ignore new anomalies during `grade_period` seconds immediately after an anomaly
* All default model settings are set if missing, and returned via `loudml show-model <model name>` command line
* All annotations messages now include tag information in the format: `feature {} [tag:xx,tag:yy] is too {} (score={})`
* Annotations will automatically create a new annotation database if it does not exist
* Python API for developers was changed, functions `on_anomaly_start()` and `on_anomaly_end()` no longer have the model name in their parameters. Developers can get this info using `self.model` value.
