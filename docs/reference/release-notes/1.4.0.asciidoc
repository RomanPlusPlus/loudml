== 1.4.0 Release Notes

The changes listed below have been released for the first time in Loud ML 1.4.0.

[NOTE]
==================================================
Please raise issues on https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues[Github] if you experience compatibility issues on your system.

[[overview-1.4.0]]

=== Overview

1.4 is a significant update in several areas, including a security update.

If you’re using release 1.3.x, please migrate to 1.4.0 to avoid sensitive information being leaked via the REST API. Now, onto new and improved functionality.

New awesome functions include:

* Forecast: in 1.3, you could already forecast stationary data (ie, where the patterns are centered around a mean value). Now, in 1.4 you can also forecast non-stationary data that deviates from its mean. This makes Loud ML a good fit for predictive maintenance applications!
* New data connectors natively and seamlessly supported out-of-the-box include:
** https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/?nc1=h_ls[Elasticsearch AWS service]
** https://www.warp10.io/[Warp 10]
** https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB]
* Live anomaly detection. We’re thrilled to roll out significant enhancements in this area. Read on to learn more.
 

[[improvements-1.4.0]]

=== Improvements

Several major enhancements to live anomaly detection are included in Loud ML 1.4: 

* https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/36[#36]: all output predictions are automatically tagged with the same tag(s) used in the model definition; for example, if your model contains a match_all section with two conditions matching key `port`=`123` and `dc`=`ams1` then output predictions written to the `prediction_%model_name` measurement will automatically contain the two tags: `port`=`123` and `dc`=`ams1`.
* Lower and upper: All output predictions written to the measurement `prediction_%model_name` will automatically include a `lower_%feature` and `upper_%feature` fields that represent the floor and ceiling value for predicted values, providing a 95% confidence interval.
* Scoring: all output predictions written to the measurement `prediction_%model_name` automatically include a `score` field in range [0, 100], and `is_anomaly` (True|False) tag. This will allow users to plot the score value, tracking the anomalies over time and integrating easily with third-party alerting applications.
* Automated thresholding: if you set `min_threshold`=0, and `max_threshold`=0, Loud ML will automatically calculate the optimal values during training, so if you don`t know which threshold values to use, leave it at zero! Note: you can override these values later on using the REST API.
* Automated annotations: for each anomaly, annotations compatible with InfluxData https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/chronograf/[Chronograf] database will automatically be inserted in the database if you want them to be. Note: this feature is only compatible with InfluxDB at the time of writing. Learn more in the documentation. 

Data model improvements:

* You can now use `default`: `previous` in your data model definition. This tells Loud ML to fill missing values with previous values when the values don`t exist in the TSDB for a given time interval.
* You can now use `transform`: `diff` in your data model definition. This allows Loud ML to forecast non-stationary data; ie, data that isn`t centered around its mean.

[[fixes-1.4.0]]
[float]
=== Bug fixes

The 1.4 release introduces important bug fixes:

* Important security fix: no longer leak password or other sensitive information via the REST API. If you are using 1.3.x release, please migrate to 1.4.0!
* Enhanced support and bug fixes for https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.x/index.html[Elasticsearch 6.x]
* Several bug and stability fixes in the loudmld API running background jobs.
* Fixed bug https://github.com/regel/loudml/issues/17[#17]: loudmld not listening on TCP port if /var/lib/loudml contains unexpected content

[[breaking-1.4.0]]
[float]
=== Breaking changes

Few breaking changes have been made:

* Since doc_type was removed in Elasticsearch 6.x https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.0/removal-of-types.html[(see removal of types)] Loud ML is now writing predicted data points to a new index named according to each model's name.
* loudmld _forecast API now accepts a `bg` parameter. If `bg`=`true`, it will run an asynchronous job in the background. On the contrary, if `bg` option is missing or `false`, it will run synchronously and return the forecast result in JSON format.
