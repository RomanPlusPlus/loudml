Loud ML provides a full Feature DSL (Domain Specific Language) based on JSON to define
how data must be organized in memory in order to produce the right model and
predictive output with your data set.

Think of the Feature DSL as an abstract syntax consisting of two types of
structures:

Timeseries types::

Timeseries types aggregate data based on a particular field, or script,
to produce <<timeseries-dsl,`numeric`>> features. These features
can be used by themselves to predict their trend in the near future.

Organized types::

Organized features wrap other compound features and are used to combine
multiple categorical and numerical properties in a logical fashion. These
features are used to discover patterns in the data.
