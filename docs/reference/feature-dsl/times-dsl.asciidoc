== Timeseries Features DSL

Defines how time series data must be aggregated into features
for learning and inference.

The list below defines the aggregation operators can be used to
define features. These values can be extracted by using numeric
fields in the data source documents.

[NOTE]
==================================================

This version does not support feature generation by a provided script,
nor extracting features from non numeric fields.

==================================================

The operators that are supported consist of: `count`, `min`, `max`, `sum`,
`avg`, `sum_of_squares`, `variance`, and `std_deviation`.

[NOTE]
==================================================

This version supports the following additional operators with InfluxDb:
`derivative`, `integral`, `spread`, `mode`, `5percentile`, `10percentile`,
`90percentile`, `95percentile`, `stddev`
