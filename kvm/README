This directory contains files to build images for KVM. This will be better
integrated into the buildchain later.

Requirements
============

- Packer from HashiCorp
- build repository extracted in the "repo-build" directory


Instructions
============

Build instructions for QCOW images:
- set path to "packer" in rules.mk
- run "make elastic" to generate elasticsearch.qcow2 in the current directory

To debug Packer provisioning, it is possible to use a builder of type "Null".
